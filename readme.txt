Welcome to our CST 205 Steganography Project!

When you run the project2.py file, you will be prompted to either encrypt or decrypt something.
If you have nothing to decrypt, choose encrypt.

1. Encrypt
	Here you can choose to:
		Encrypt text into an image of your choice
		Encrypt an image into an image of your choice

	Text Into Image:
		<TBD>
	Image Into Image:
		When you hit the encrypt button, you will be prompted first for the cover image (image you want to be seen publicly), then for the secret image (image you want to hide)
		Then, the program creates an image called hidden.png in whatever directory you forked into

2. Decrypt
	Here you can choose to:
		Decrypt text from an encrypted image
		Decrypt an image from an encrypted image
		See if an image has been encrypted with anything by our program

	Text From Image:
		<TBD>
	Image From Image:
		<TBD>
	Test For Encryption:
		<TBD>
